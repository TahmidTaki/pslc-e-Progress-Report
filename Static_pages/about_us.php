        <h3 class="text-xl text-center">History</h3>
        <img src="../images/st_pages/head.png" class="mx-auto" alt="">
        <p>
        I'm Ruwinah Abdul Karim, an occupational therapist and the Head of Clinical Therapy of Penawar Special Learning Center (PSLC). When I took over the practice in 2018 it was only offering occupational therapy services. It soon became clear that there was a demand for other therapy services to meet the needs of children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, and the practice expanded to offer child psychology, play therapy & speech and language therapy. <br>   <br>    

In addition to these, we now offer art therapy, play therapy and hippotherapy & Electroencephalogram (EEG) test making us a truly holistic practice offering a full range of assessment, diagnostic, and intervention services to children, families and schools. We can often cross-refer within our team of experts and many of our children benefit from using more than
one of our services. Currently, we are having 10 branches around Malaysia. We are also planning to open up more centers all over Malaysia in coming years.
        </p>

            Philosophy
        </h3>
        <p>The aim of Penawar Special Leaming Center (PSLC) is to provide a friendly and enjoyable environment for children, with a focus on best practice in therapy. Training and professional developmentis a key strength of the team, and all the staff at PSLCs share a love for what they do and a desire to maximise every child's progress.

Therapists provide full support to children with additional needs and their families, and the team enjoys working closely together with more complex cases when multiple services are needed. They are experienced in supporting and involving parents and teaching staff in order to ensure therapy has the best chance of success across all areas of a childâ€™s life.

Private health services can seem daunting, but we are an ethical practice that supplements the government services for local children in schools and clinics. Our team works jointly with the child's (government) therapists & teachers whenever possible, and focuses on joint goals to maximise progress.</p>
